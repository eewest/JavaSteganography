# JavaSteganography
This is a Java based steganography library. This project began as and is still a hobby that I came across while looking for a project to do
during my summer. This project currently applies the concept of steganography, to hide data within data, to hide text files and images within images. I plan 
to further expand this to other types of files and data.

# What is steganography?
Steganography is the hiding of information within other information regardless of the type or format of either data. 

# How does this code work
This code works by first taking in some data that you want to hide and breaking it up into bits. Then it takes these bits and writes them 
to the image's pixels rgb values Least Significant Bit after zeroing that bit out.

# Requirements
To use this project you must have the following installed  
* Java SDK 
* Java JRE
